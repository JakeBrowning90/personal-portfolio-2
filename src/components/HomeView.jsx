        My name is Jake, and I love solving puzzles, simplifying complex
        concepts, and creating beautiful things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my web development career with an elective course, and have
        since cultivated my skills through IT studies, professional networking,
        and self-teaching with online resources.
